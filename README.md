## Analysis and Prediction of House prices

A brief analysis of Sci-kits Boston house prices dataset and after a while, I will also add a prediction tool written in Python.
This was done for a course assignment. In the analysis part, some variables have been tested for dropping. Dropping a couple of values seemed to have no significant decrease in our accuracy so we've dropped them. Also they'll be dropped also in the valuation tool.

### Getting Started

This was written on Jupyter notebook with Python by using the libraries and modules which can be seen below.

### Models and Data Used

Data: Boston housing prices dataset, which belongs to Scikit. The sklearn Boston dataset is used wisely in regression and is famous dataset from the 1970â€™s. There are 506 instances and 14 attributes.

Models: Regressions

### Libraries Used 


```
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodel
```


## Further Works
I will add a python tool that will predict the houseprice based from some given parameters. Stay tuned :)
